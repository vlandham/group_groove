<p>A little bookmarklet to turn Grooveshark into a collaborative playlist service.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to combine Grooveshark's broadcasting capabilities with a hack to auto-accept all listener suggestions to transform the broadcast into something truly communal </p>

<h3>
<a id="setup" class="anchor" href="#setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup</h3>

<p>One user is both a <strong>broadcaster</strong> as well as a subscriber (I suggest having 2 separate accounts for this). All other interested parties are subscribers with special privileges. </p>

<p><strong>Broadcaster</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>login to Grooveshark</li>
<li>add a few songs to your queue</li>
<li>start broadcasting your queue</li>
<li>share the broadcast link somewhere public - where others can find it</li>
<li>keep your Grooveshark page open to <strong>Overview</strong> or <strong>Suggestions</strong> panel</li>
<li>run Group Groove bookmarklet on page</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Subscribers</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>get link from broadcaster</li>
<li>subscribe and start listening to broadcast</li>
<li>navigate around and suggest more songs</li>
<li>they will be automatically added to the broadcast!</li>
<li>voila - collaborative playlists for you and your friends</li>
</ul>

<a id="shortcomings-and-caveats" class="anchor" href="#shortcomings-and-caveats" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shortcomings and Caveats</h3>

<p>I would recommend the broadcaster use a separate account for broadcasting and subscribing - which lets you keep the broadcast panel open at the right spot. You can mute the audio from the broadcaster account easily - so you don't get doubled up on songs. </p>

<p>Grooveshark wants to kill broadcasts that aren't actively playing music. I'm not sure what the time limit on this is. But this might limit the reuse of a consistent broadcast link. There might be a way to persist broadcast links in other ways.</p>

<p>Doesn't seem to be a good way to pause the playlist. You are set into autoplay immediately. If you stop, the broadcast is over. </p>

<p>Can be difficult for subscribers to see what songs are coming up. Not sure if there is a way to see this.</p>
