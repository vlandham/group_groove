{"name":"Group groove","tagline":"","body":"### Group Groove\r\n\r\nA little bookmarklet to turn Grooveshark into a collaborative playlist service.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to combine Grooveshark's broadcasting capabilities with a hack to auto-accept all listener suggestions to transform the broadcast into something truly communal \r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nOne user is both a **broadcaster** as well as a subscriber (I suggest having 2 separate accounts for this). All other interested parties are subscribers with special privileges. \r\n\r\n**Broadcaster**\r\n\r\n - login to Grooveshark\r\n - add a few songs to your queue\r\n - start broadcasting your queue\r\n - share the broadcast link somewhere public - where others can find it\r\n - keep your Grooveshark page open to **Overview** or **Suggestions** panel\r\n - run Group Groove bookmarklet on page\r\n\r\n**Subscribers**\r\n\r\n - get link from broadcaster\r\n - subscribe and start listening to broadcast\r\n - navigate around and suggest more songs\r\n - they will be automatically added to the broadcast!\r\n - voila - collaborative playlists for you and your friends\r\n\r\n### Shortcomings and Caveats\r\n\r\nI would recommend the broadcaster use a separate account for broadcasting and subscribing - which lets you keep the broadcast panel open at the right spot. You can mute the audio from the broadcaster account easily - so you don't get doubled up on songs. \r\n\r\nGrooveshark wants to kill broadcasts that aren't actively playing music. I'm not sure what the time limit on this is. But this might limit the reuse of a consistent broadcast link. There might be a way to persist broadcast links in other ways.\r\n\r\nDoesn't seem to be a good way to pause the playlist. You are set into autoplay immediately. If you stop, the broadcast is over. \r\n\r\nCan be difficult for subscribers to see what songs are coming up. Not sure if there is a way to see this.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
